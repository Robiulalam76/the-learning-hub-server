            "description": "HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but HTML 2.0 was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012. Why to Learn HTML Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like heading paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language. HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning HTML. Create Web site - You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know HTML well. Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill. Understand web - If you want to optimize your website, to boost its speed and performance, it is good to know HTML to yield best results. Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand."

I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript: Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmerâ€™s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc. Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript. Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience. JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer. Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market."

It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.Our ReactJS tutorial includes all the topics which help to learn ReactJS. These are ReactJS Introduction, ReactJS Features, ReactJS Installation, Pros and Cons of ReactJS, ReactJS JSX, ReactJS Components, ReactJS State, ReactJS Props, ReactJS Forms, ReactJS Events, ReactJS Animation and many more. Why we use ReactJS? The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps."

            "description": "React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React Native specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not. What's going on here? First of all, we need to import React to be able to use JSX, which will then be transformed to the native components of each platform. On line 2, we import the Text and View components from react-native Then we define the HelloWorldApp function, which is a functional component and behaves in the same way as in React for the web. This function returns a View component with some styles and aText as its child. The Text component allows us to render a text, while the View component renders a container. This container has several styles applied, let's analyze what each one is doing. The first style that we find is flex: 1, the flex prop will define how your items are going to fill over the available space along your main axis. Since we only have one container, it will take all the available space of the parent component. In this case, it is the only component, so it will take all the available screen space. The following style is justifyContent: center. This aligns children of a container in the center of the container's main axis. Finally, we have alignItems: center, which aligns children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis. Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you. Don't panic. This is the future. First of all, ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development. React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. import, export, const and from in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren't familiar with ES2015, you can probably pick it up by reading through sample code like this tutorial has. If you want, this page has a good overview of ES2015 features."

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python programming language starting from basic conceopts to advanced concepts. This tutorial will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Python Programming language. Python Jobs Today, Python is very high in demand and all the major companies are looking for great Python Programmers to develop websites, software components, and applications or to work with Data Science, AI, and ML technologies.

I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++: C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development. C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification. C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work. C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development. C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming.
